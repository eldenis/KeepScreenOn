# Keep Screen On
A simple console app to keep windows from turning off the screen and locking the user out.

Just execute it and presto. Every 45 secs the app will simulate a key stroke (shift key) and that'll keep windows from fading/turning off the screen or locking the current user out.

To allow the computer to go back to sleep again, simply press a key or close the app.

This is specially useful when you're watching a video or simply using your PC in a way that no interaction from the user is necessary but you still need the screen/speakers to stay on.

I made this app out of necessity since VLC used to do this with a paused video even but since version 3.0 the developers "fixed that bug" and now it doesn't work the same way it did before.
